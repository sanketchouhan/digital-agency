                    Starting us off, we have Smashing Magazine. It’s not often that you find a publication that can put

                    as many high-quality
                    articles as consistently as Smashing can. Some places publish lots of articles that have very little
                    substance,
                    but Smashing Magazine makes sure that pretty much every word they publish is relevant to you as a
                    designer
                    and developer. They also do various freebies and host conferences, as well as put out books on

                    across
                    our field, too.

                    Some places publish lots of articles that have very little substance, but Smashing Magazine makes

                    that pretty much every
                    word they publish is relevant to you as a designer and developer.
